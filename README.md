### Active Directory Lab Series
- This repo documents my Active Directory lab practice, showing transferable IT support skills in user management, GPOs, and troubleshooting.

### Skills Demonstrated
- User account creation and management
- Group Policy Objects (password policies, drive mapping)
- File sharing and permissions
- Documentation and troubleshooting

### [Active Directory Lab Project – User Account Provisioning & Security Policies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPK2QXLEqZA&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=4)
- Created and managed multiple domain user accounts in Active Directory, applying best practices for account setup and management. 
- Implemented domain‑wide password complexity requirements through Group Policy to strengthen authentication security across all users.
- Documented and tested configuration changes to ensure compliance and functionality for diverse user accounts.

### [Changing windows server hostname and promoting windows server to the domain controller] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK9bdACTdMY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=3) 
- Changed the hostname to ensure unique identification and prevent IP/DNS conflicts with the host machine.
- Verified configuration worked successfully and that the Domain Name was changed for the DNS Server and IP address.
- Demonstrated installing the Active Directory Domain Services role, then using the post‑installation wizard to promote the Windows Server VM to a Domain Controller, establishing centralized     authentication, DNS, and domain management for the lab environment.

### [Integration of client virtual machine to the network domain and domain controller network] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7pMWzrqLRY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=2)
- Demonstrated troubleshooting client VM connectivity by assigning a static IP and updating DNS settings. Initial pings to the server timed out, but after reconfiguration the client              successfully joined the domain, confirming the fix.

### [Renaming client hostname for windows server active directory] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEAT6Mj-tvY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=1)
- Demonstrated troubleshooting client VM registration in Active Directory. Initially, the computer name was not recognized under the Computers tab. After renaming the client VM hostname, the     updated name appeared correctly in Active Directory Users and Computers, confirming successful domain integration.
