### [Active Directory Lab Project – User Account Provisioning & Security Policies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPK2QXLEqZA&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=4)
- Created and managed multiple domain user accounts in Active Directory, applying best practices for account setup and management. 
- Implemented domain‑wide password complexity requirements through Group Policy to strengthen authentication security across all users.
- Documented and tested configuration changes to ensure compliance and functionality for diverse user accounts.

### [Active Directory Lab Project - Changing windows server hostname and promoting windows server to the domain controller] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK9bdACTdMY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=3) 
- Changed the hostname to ensure unique identification and prevent IP/DNS conflicts with the host machine.
- Verified configuration worked successfully and that the Domain Name was changed for the DNS Server and IP address.
- Demonstrated installing the Active Directory Domain Services role, then using the post‑installation wizard to promote the Windows Server VM to a Domain Controller, establishing centralized     authentication, DNS, and domain management for the lab environment.

### [Active Directory Lab Project - Integration of client virtual machine to the network domain and domain controller network] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7pMWzrqLRY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=2)
- Demonstrated troubleshooting client VM connectivity by assigning a static IP and updating DNS settings. Initial pings to the server timed out, but after reconfiguration the client              successfully joined the domain, confirming the fix.

### [Active Directory Lab Project - Renaming client hostname for windows server active directory] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEAT6Mj-tvY&list=PL_lSJ8mxqCJF4Ml22zgdR08Q-nrgfLRtv&index=1)
- Demonstrated troubleshooting client VM registration in Active Directory. Initially, the computer name was not recognized under the Computers tab. After renaming the client VM hostname, the     updated name appeared correctly in Active Directory Users and Computers, confirming successful domain integration.

### [Active Directory Lab Project - Static IP Assignment, Subnetting, TCPIP and Default Gateway Configurations] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DXysYyU-V8)
- Configured virtual machine network types (Host‑Only, NAT, Bridged) to test connectivity scenarios.
- Assigned static IP settings including subnet mask, Subnet, default gateway, and DNS server.
- Verified configuration using ipconfig /all in Command Prompt.
- Tested connectivity by pinging the default gateway to confirm successful network setup.

### [Active Directory Lab Project - Windows Upgrades and Installations] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsxukOu-6rg)
- Installed Windows 11 ISO on a client virtual machine.
- Installed VMware Tools to enable optimized performance, seamless integration, and enhanced device drivers within the virtual environment.
- Configured Microsoft Office 365 applications and set up email connectivity (Exchange Online).
- Renamed the client hostname for clear identification in Active Directory Users and Computers.
- Upgraded Windows Server prior to configuring it as a Domain Controller.

### [Active Directory Lab: Account Lockout Policy Configuration] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeSPQZq5960) 
- Created and applied a Group Policy Object (GPO) for account lockout
- Configured lockout threshold, duration, and reset counter
- Tested policy with multiple failed login attempts
- Verified lockout behavior across domain user accounts
- Documented troubleshooting steps and results

### [Active Directory Lab: Mapped Network Drive with Firewall & Connectivity Testing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZvpB62GIOU)
- Created and shared a folder on the server for Staff OU
- Configured NTFS and Share permissions for controlled access
- Applied Group Policy Object (GPO) to automatically map the drive
- Implemented firewall policies to allow SMB traffic and secure access
- Used ping and other commands to verify network connectivity
- Tested drive mapping with multiple domain user accounts
- Documented troubleshooting steps and results

### [Active Directory Lab: NTFS Permissions & Access Control] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMFVMNhdLuQ) 
- Created shared folders for Staff and Students
- Applied NTFS and Share permissions with different access levels
- Tested access using multiple domain user accounts
- Verified restrictions and troubleshooting steps
- Documented results for IT support practice
